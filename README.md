# Valencia Green Areas and Public Transport Accessibility API

This FastAPI application processes geospatial data of Valencia city retrieved from external URLs and stores it in a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS support. The API provides endpoints to analyze and deliver valuable urban indicators by neighborhoods ("barrios") related to green spaces and public transport accessibility.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:**  
  Fetches geospatial datasets of Valencia from online sources and inserts them into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.

- **Green Areas Ratios Endpoint:**  
  Calculates and returns ratios of green area per surface and per inhabitant for each neighborhood.

- **Public Transport Accessibility Endpoint:**  
  Analyzes accessibility to MetroValencia and EMT bus stops by neighborhood, based on a pedestrian walkable graph.  
  - Computes the proportion of walkable graph nodes within each neighborhood that have access to public transport stops within a defined threshold.  
  - Calculates the nearest public transport stop to the centroid of each neighborhood.

- **Combined Indicator Endpoint:**  
  Provides a GeoJSON response with a composite indicator for each neighborhood, combining:  
  - The percentage of accessible walkable nodes  
  - The green area ratio  
  through a linear combination, giving a holistic view of green space and transit accessibility.

## Technologies

- FastAPI for building the API  
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial database management  
- GeoPandas and NetworkX for geospatial and graph analysis  
- Python libraries such as Shapely, SQLAlchemy, and others for spatial computations  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository  
2. Configure environment variables (database credentials, data URLs, etc.) in a `.env` file (not tracked in Git)  
3. Run the FastAPI app with Uvicorn  
4. Access endpoints to obtain urban indicators by neighborhood

This project helps urban planners and researchers evaluate the availability of green spaces and public transport accessibility across Valenciaâ€™s neighborhoods, supporting sustainable city development.
